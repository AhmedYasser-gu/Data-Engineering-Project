# Code-Of-Conduct ( Team contract )
# Team-11
##### Members: Ahmed Yasser/ Alex Nordin/ Axel Broberg/ Adam Telles/ Niklas Höglund

### How do we plan to collaborate?
- The team planned to collaborate on this project remotely via **Discord** (voice channel and screen sharing, etc..) since everyone is familiar with it, having a good productive working history on that platform.

- However, when needed the team is available to meet **on Campus**. However, when needed the team is available to meet on Campus, also after every lecture the team will usually meet up to discuss the project plans and to check if everyone is on the same page.

- We will have a scrum meeting at the beginning of the week to update everyone on the work that is being done and what needs to be done, and a meeting at the end of the week to do code review.

- Our team might work in pairs when coding, or individually.

### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

- All team members are expected to attend all required meetings to be on the same page.

- We expect our team members to keep an open dialogue about their work on the platforms we are using for communication. Judging by prior experience our team is most comfortable using our discord chat room for this, but Trello will also be in some use.
More formal sharing of information will be done in the two weekly scrum meetings. 

- Each member is expected to keep a logbook of the work they do each day. 

### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

- The weekly code review meeting will be a formal opportunity for each of our team members to present their work and explain it to the rest of the team.

- Our team is also, in our experience, eager and willing to share knowledge and will do so outside of the code review session through the communication tools available, as well as when we meet in person. We also agree that it’s each member's individual responsibility to ask for help or clarification when there are concepts that the member does not fully understand related to the project. 

### What is our usual communication plan?

- On our Discord channel or in person, team members are required to keep the rest of the group up to date on project-related issues.

- The team agrees on **Monday and Friday** to be our weekly days to meet (Sprint  Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, etc...), if required there can be additional times to meet up.

- On days we have lectures, most or all of our team will be on campus. If an individual's schedule permits this is an opportunity to collaborate in person and share knowledge and ideas. In instances where we require help from the TA’s, one or more of our team will go on campus to inquire them for assistance.

- Some of our team members, likely those who do not live far from the city, might meet on campus more frequently to collaborate. 



### How will we solve conflicts?

- We plan to keep a friendly environment in our workspace so everyone feels free and open to communicate or discuss about their own ideas, part of us being a Scrum team we will have dedicated time during every Sprint Retrospective ( most probably Friday ) to talk about what went well , bad and possible issues that may affect our work in the future so we avoid any possible obstacles in our way of work.

- We shall also talk about how to improve communication , planning in every Sprint Retrospective or even at Sprint Planning , if we find the need for it.

- The way to approach anything in our project will be through voting and to go with the majority.

- If someone feels burned out or not well , that team member can get a break.


- In this way we can avoid any future conflicts by being updated on everyone’s ideas and feedback weekly ( about work environment , requirements  and work progress ).
